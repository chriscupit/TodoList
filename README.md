# TodoList
This project was create a functional todo list allowing the user to add and delete items from the list.  It also required the use of multiple files to keep everything organized.  This project used index.html, form.js, index.js, styles.css and todo.js.  The use of the file preview within vs code was also useful as you can see the real time changes made to the code.  I did make a few styling changes to the project such as background coloring and item centering.
